Gallery Documentation
=====================

Photos are sorted by year, and for each year there is a set of featured images you need to pick out.

To add or remove a year, go to "Gallery Years", under "Media". The only important field there is the name. The slug, parent and description do not matter and can be left blank.

You can add new photos in two ways. You can click "Add New" in the "Media" section, and then tag them by their year in the "Media" section (using the "Bulk Actions" dropdown). This is only recommended if you are adding a few images.

A much more efficient way of adding many images is to put all the images in a zip file, and upload the file to the server using a FTP program. Then go to "Add from server", under "Media" and navigate to the directory you uploaded the file to. Select the file, choose a year to add the photos to, and click on Import. The photos will be added and automatically tagged with the year you selected. In case this fails, split the photos up into multiple smaller zip files, and try again with each one.

You can easily rotate images in the "Media" section, using the "Bulk Actions" dropdown.

Once you add photos for a year, you should also add a featured gallery for that year. Click "Add new" under "Featured Galleries", and choose the year that the featured gallery is for. Then choose images for the gallery (select multiple images by holding CTRL). The name of the featured gallery is not displayed anywhere, and is only for your own reference.

To tag bib numbers quickly, go to "Bib tagging" under media.
